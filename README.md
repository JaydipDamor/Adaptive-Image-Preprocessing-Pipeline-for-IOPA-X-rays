Adaptive Image Preprocessing Pipeline for IOPA X-rays

The primary challenge addressed in this assignment  is the significant variability in image quality across different dental imaging software and devices used in clinical settings. IOPA (Intraoral Periapical) X-ray images often exhibit inconsistent characteristics including:

Brightness variations: Images may be too dark or too bright depending on exposure settings
Contrast differences: Some images lack sufficient contrast while others may be over-contrasted
Sharpness inconsistencies: Blurry images due to patient movement or equipment issues
Noise levels: Varying degrees of noise from different imaging sensors and acquisition parameters

These variations significantly impact the performance of downstream AI models used for dental diagnosis and treatment planning. A static preprocessing approach fails to handle this diversity effectively, necessitating an adaptive solution that can intelligently adjust preprocessing parameters based on individual image characteristics.
Dataset Description
For this assignment, I designed the pipeline to handle:

DICOM format files (.dcm): Primary medical imaging format with rich metadata
Standard image formats (.jpg, .png): For broader compatibility
Varied image characteristics: The pipeline is designed to automatically detect and handle:

Low/high brightness images
Low/high contrast images
Blurry/over-sharp images
High/low noise images



The pipeline extracts and utilizes DICOM metadata including:

PhotometricInterpretation
PixelSpacing
WindowCenter/WindowWidth
RescaleIntercept/RescaleSlope

Methodology
1. Image Quality Metrics Implementation
I implemented comprehensive image quality assessment using multiple complementary metrics:
Brightness Metrics

Mean Pixel Intensity: Simple average of all pixel values
Used to determine if images are too dark (<80) or too bright (>180)

Contrast Metrics

Standard Deviation: Measures pixel intensity variation
RMS Contrast: Root Mean Square contrast for robust measurement
Michelson Contrast: Normalized contrast measure using (max-min)/(max+min)

Sharpness Metrics

Laplacian Variance: Measures edge content using second derivatives
Tenengrad Method: Uses Sobel gradient magnitudes for sharpness assessment

Noise Estimation

Standard Deviation Method: Compares original with median-filtered image
Wavelet-based Method: Uses skimage's estimate_sigma for robust noise estimation

2. Static Preprocessing Baseline
The static preprocessing pipeline applies fixed transformations:
pythondef static_preprocess(image):
    # Normalize to 0-255 range
    normalized = cv2.normalize(image, None, 0, 255, cv2.NORM_MINMAX)
    
    # Fixed histogram equalization
    equalized = cv2.equalizeHist(normalized)
    
    # Fixed sharpening kernel
    sharpened = cv2.filter2D(equalized, -1, sharpening_kernel)
    
    # Fixed bilateral filtering
    denoised = cv2.bilateralFilter(sharpened, 5, 50, 50)
    
    return denoised
Limitations of Static Approach:

Over-processes already well-exposed images
Under-processes severely degraded images
Fixed parameters cannot adapt to varying noise levels
May introduce artifacts in images that don't need specific enhancements

3. Adaptive Preprocessing Pipeline
The adaptive pipeline intelligently adjusts preprocessing based on image analysis:
Adaptive Brightness Adjustment
pythonif brightness < 80:        # Too dark
    enhanced = cv2.convertScaleAbs(image, alpha=1.2, beta=20)
elif brightness > 180:     # Too bright  
    enhanced = cv2.convertScaleAbs(image, alpha=0.8, beta=-10)
Adaptive Contrast Enhancement

Low contrast (std < 30): Strong CLAHE with clipLimit=3.0
High contrast (std > 80): Mild histogram equalization with blending
Normal contrast: Standard CLAHE with clipLimit=2.0

Adaptive Sharpening

Blurry images (Laplacian < 100): Strong sharpening with careful blending
Sharp images (Laplacian > 500): Minimal sharpening to avoid artifacts
Moderate sharpness: Standard unsharp masking

Adaptive Denoising

High noise (std > 15): Bilateral + Non-local means denoising
Moderate noise (8 < std < 15): Bilateral filtering
Low noise (3 < std < 8): Light bilateral filtering
Minimal noise (std < 3): Gaussian blur only

4. Machine Learning Approach Concept
For a more sophisticated ML-based approach, I propose:
Classification-Based Method
python# Train classifier to categorize image quality
quality_classes = ['low_contrast_low_noise', 'high_contrast_high_noise', 
                   'blurry_clean', 'sharp_noisy']

# Apply class-specific preprocessing pipelines
preprocessing_strategies = {
    'low_contrast_low_noise': strong_contrast_enhancement,
    'high_contrast_high_noise': noise_reduction_priority,
    # ... etc
}
Deep Learning Enhancement

U-Net Architecture: For image-to-image translation
Training Strategy: Synthetic degradation of high-quality images
Loss Function: Combination of MSE, SSIM, and perceptual loss

Challenges for ML Approach:

Limited training data for medical images
Need for paired high-quality/degraded images
Computational complexity for real-time processing
Validation on diverse clinical datasets
